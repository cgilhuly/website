									<p>I am a firm believer that astronomers and scientists in general have a responsibility to engage with their wider
communities to educate and excite both students and the general public. And it's fun, too! Astronomy is
a unique field that captures the imagination of so many individuals at some point in their lives. Being able to engage with curious people of all ages is always energizing and incredibly rewarding.</p> 

<p>During my time at Queen's University, I volunteered with <a href="https://letstalkscience.ca/">Let's Talk Science</a>. This organization delivers STEM programs
with hands-on activities to schools and youth groups, and also participates in community-wide outreach events. I developed a workshop kit
on galaxies for our local chapter, helped other students develop a kit on the solar system, and sat on the organizing committee for the
Let's Talk Physics 2016 symposium in addition to visiting many classrooms. I also assisted
at monthly open house events at the <a href="http://observatory.phy.queensu.ca/">Queen's Observatory.</a> </p>

<p>Since moving to Toronto, I've been involved with <a href="http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~gasa/astrotours/">AstroTours</a>. AstroTours
is a series of monthly outreach events run entirely by graduate students. Each Tour features a public lecture followed by telescope observing, 
interactive demos, and free planetarium shows. 
I largely volunteered to operate telescopes in my first year, and am currently the AstroTours personnel manager for 2018-2019.
